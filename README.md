# 📧 **Email/SMS Spam Classifier using Machine Learning**

This project is a machine learning-based web app that classifies emails and SMS messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam**. Developed using **Streamlit**, it provides a user-friendly interface for real-time classification powered by various machine learning models.

The application includes model training, evaluation, testing, and performance comparison between popular classification algorithms such as **Decision Tree**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **Gradient Boosting**.

## 🚀 **Features**

- **Real-Time Spam Detection**  
  Instantly classify any email or SMS text using a clean, intuitive web interface.

- **Multiple Machine Learning Models**  
  Trained with:
  - **Decision Tree**
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - **Gradient Boosting Classifier**

- **Performance Comparison**  
  Visual comparison of models based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and testing results.

- **Text Preprocessing Pipeline**  
  Uses tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and TF-IDF vectorization.
